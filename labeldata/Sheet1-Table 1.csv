Amenhotep,Statue of Amenhotep III,EA4,Granodiorite,"18th Dynasty, reign of Amenhotep III (about 1390–1352 BC)","Temple of Amenhotep III, Thebes",Granodiorite seated statue of Amenhotep III; restored.,"The pose and iconography repeat those of the statue on the left. Both come from the king’s mortuary temple in Western Thebes. It housed hundreds of statues of himself and the gods. Several more are displayed in this gallery.
The temple, one of Egypt’s largest, stood on the border between desert and fertile land west of the River Nile. It accommodated the ruler’s posthumous offering cult. His tomb lies miles away, in a secluded desert valley.",
Right Lion,King Amenhotep III as a Lion (right),EA2,Red granite,"18th Dynasty, reign of Amenhotep III (about 1390–1352 BC)","From Napata (Gebel Barkal, Sudan); originally from Soleb (Sudan)","Red granite statue of lion of Amenhotep III: this lion is  depicted in a recumbent pose, forming a mirror image to  its companion piece. It lies on its side: the forepaws  crossed, the farther of the hind paws emerging from  under the nearer one, the tail curling forward around the  rump and resting on the base. The sculpture combines  marvelously the stylized mane and hair with a naturalistic  treatment of the body. The muzzle projects realistically,  with solid jawbones and raised veins. A stylized circular  mane frames the head, and the fur is rendered by a  raised surface on the chest, the shoulders, and the  back. The eyes are hollowed and were probably inlaid.  The whiskers are incised on the muzzle; small, round  protuberances in the ear suggest the tufts of hair. The  naturalistic treatment of the physiognomy is enhanced  by anatomical details - for example, the twisted hind  paws, of which the farther one is turned upward. On the  external side of the paws, the folds are marked by deep  furrows. The rump is treated with a bold modeling of  musculature; and parallel depressions alternate with  raised ribs on the flank. The lion was later reinscribed  several times. First a four-column text was engraved on  the breast, identifying the monument as ""The good god,  lion of rulers, wild when he sees his enemies treading his  path, [it is the king] ... divine ruler of Thebes, who  brought it."" The royal cartouche, in which only the last  signs are preserved, could belong to Akhenaten. Shortly  afterward, a text of Tutankhamun's was inscribed on the  base, stating that the king renewed this monument for  Amenhotep III. Ultimately, during the reuse of these  lions in Gebel Barkal, the two cartouches of the Kushite  ruler Amanislo were added on both lions.These  cartouches occupy the left forepaw, because of the  anterior four-column inscription. It was probably also at  that time that the names of Tutankhamun in the third  and fourth cartouches on the base were erased (with  the exception of ""Amun"" and a remnant of ""ankh"") to be  replaced by those of Amanislo, on a plaster patch that is  now lost, leaving the original particle of Amun, common  to both names.","This statue and its companion declare the king’s might by representing him as a lion. Pharaohs were often shown as a sphinx with the body of a lion, but the full lion image is rare. An inscription on the chest, added by Amenhotep IV, calls the king a ‘lion of rulers, wild when he sees his enemies tread his path’. The sculptures are famed for their realistic anatomical detail and depart from the frontality of most Egyptian statues. The eyes were originally inlaid.
Amenhotep III commissioned the lion sculptures for the temple of Amun-Ra at Soleb in Upper Nubia, in the conquered former kingdom of Kush. The next king, Amenhotep IV (later called Akhenaten), ensured that both reached Soleb after his father’s untimely death. In the text on the base, Amenhotep III is honoured by his grandson, Tutankhamun. A thousand years later the statues so impressed the Kushite ruler Amanislo that he moved them 500 km south to the city of Napata. Here Amanislo’s names appear on the left foreleg.",

for royalty and the elite. The panel design
depicts a palace façade. The side that faced
east includes two false doors. Most Egyptian
tombs lie on the edge of the western desert,
so the dead were buried facing east, towards
the living – who brought them offerings.
An inscription on the same side, near the top,
named the owner but was erased, perhaps
to curse him. The bosses on the lid served to
manoeuvre it in place.",
Nesptah,Offering table of Nesptah,EA 1485,Granodiorite,"Early 26th Dynasty, reign of Psamtek I, about 650 BC","From Thebes, probably from Asasif",Granodiorite offering-table of Nesptah;  Hieroglyphic text.,"This offering table, from a temple or tomb,
bears a depiction of a mat laid with food
offerings: loaves of bread, water vessels

over the images to purify them for magical
consumption by the owner’s spirit. The water
ran off via the spout.
The inscriptions identify the owner as
Nesptah, son of the Governor Montuemhat

It was dedicated to Horus, the falcon god of kingship. All columns resembled bundles of papyrus reed, creating the illusion of a giant marshland forest.
The builder, Amenhotep III, is named in the frame midway and on two sides of the top slab (the ‘abacus’). Merenptah and Sethnakht of the 19th and 20th Dynasties added their names on every remaining surface.",
Ram,Ram sphinx of King Taharqo,EA 1779,Granodiorite gneiss,"25th Dynasty, reign of Taharqo (690–664 BC)","From Sudan, Kawa, temple T","Granitic gneiss sphinx of the ram of Amun  protecting figure of Taharqo between  folded front legs; the rectangular base,  which has been partially restored, is  inscribed with a continuous horizontal  register of hieroglyphs.","The supreme god Amun, here represented as a ram, protects a figure of King Taharqo. The ruler’s forehead bears two cobras instead of one, an assertion of sovereignty over both his native Kush and Egypt, which the Kushites had conquered. Taharqo built and enlarged temples for Amun across his enormous realm. This and other ram sphinxes lined a processional avenue leading up to the temple of Amun at Kawa. The worship of Amun was imported to Kush during the New Kingdom, when it was ruled by the Egyptians. Centuries later, long after the land had regained its independence, the deity’s cult was promoted by Kushite kings ruling from Napata. They in turn conquered a divided Egypt,
apparently with Amun’s blessings. They largely ruled it by proxy, allowing a patchwork of small Egyptian kingdoms to endure on condition of loyalty. The Kushite kings saw themselves as Egypt’s legitimate custodians and adopted its art and customs. Alongside their Egyptian vassals they opposed the expansionist threat of Assyria.",

Monumental scarab,Colossal scarab,EA 74,Quartz diorite,"Ptolemaic Period, 3rd or 2nd century BC","From Istanbul; probably originally from Heliopolis, temple of Atum","Monumental diorite scarab beetle,  probably representing Khepri.","This is one of the largest representations of scarab beetles to survive. It also ranks among the last great statues of any pharaonic deity. The scarab represented Khepri, the form assumed by the sun-god at dawn. The Egyptians noticed that scarabs hatch from buried dung balls as if by self-creation. The sun-god was also believed to be self-creating,
renewing his powers each night before his rebirth at daybreak. Each sunrise was a repetition of the god’s first appearance at the dawn of time as the creator god Atum. The statue is made of quartz diorite, a stone not normally used for Egyptian sculpture. Three ancient quarries have been identified, deep in the Eastern Desert. Their exploitation is archaeologically confirmed for the Roman Period, but the subject and workmanship of this piece suggest that it was made a bit earlier, under the Ptolemies.
Most likely the scarab was originally set up in the temple of Atum in Heliopolis. In Roman times it was moved, probably first to Alexandria and later to Constantinople (modern Istanbul).",
Statue of Roy,Statue of Roy,EA 81,Granodiorite,"19th Dynasty, late reign of Ramesses II to reign of Sety II
(about 1220–1200 BC)","From Thebes, Karnak, temple of Mut","Granodiorite squatting figure of Ry, High  Priest of Amun during the reigns of  Ramses II, Merenptah and Sety II,  holding a Hathor-headed sistrum before,  the dorsal pillar is inscribed with two  vertical registers of hieroglyphs -  invocations to Amun-Ra and Mut; lower  section lost.","Roy, a well-known high-priest of Amun-Ra in Thebes, squats with his arms crossed on his knees. His long pleated robe was fashionable in the Ramesside period. The text on the backpillar states that the statue was placed in the temple of Mut, the wife of Amun-Ra.
Roy presents a large sistrum, a ritual rattle. This was linked to the cult of Hathor, whose cow-eared face it displays. The sistrum was also played for certain goddesses who assumed Hathoric aspects.",
Statue of Khaemwaset,Statue of Khaemwaset,EA 947,"Conglomerate,quartzite",19th Dynasty circa 1260 BC,From Asyut,"Quartzite conglomerate statue of Khaemwaset: depicted wearing a short wig and kilt and standing with left foot advanced and holding two standards: the right (now damaged) was probably surmounted by a representation of the Osirian triad and is inscribed with the prenomen and epithets of Ramses II; the left is surmounted by the fetish of Abydos and inscribed with the nomen and epithets of Ramses II. The inscription around the base contains a prayer to Atum and that around the feet of the figure describes describing the setting up of this monument in Tawer, probably at Abydos. There are two vertical registers of hieroglyphs on the dorsal pillar, continued on both the right and left sides, contain a prayer to Osiris.","In his long reign, Ramesses II (1279-1213 BC) had many sons by a number of different wives. The best-known of these is almost certainly his fourth son Khaemwaset, who has left many traces of his activities in Egypt. Early in his life, Khaemwaset was attached to the cult service of Ptah, the god of Memphis. Khaemwaset spent most of the rest of his life in the Memphite region. He is renowned as perhaps being the 'first Egyptologist', as he left large inscriptions telling of his visits to clear and renew parts of the pyramids of Giza and Saqqara. He was also responsible for work on the burial places of the Apis bulls at Saqqara, and may even have been buried near there himself. In later times Khaemwaset was recalled as a magician. This statue was probably intended to be set up in the temple at Abydos. It shows Khaemwaset displaying his piety before Osiris by holding one of the god's symbols, the emblem of the nome (province) of Abydos. The execution of the statue in a sandstone with a vein of pebbly conglomerate shows the skill with which sculptors could work even the most difficult material, producing a spectacularly coloured statue.",

Green siltstone head of a king,Green siltstone head of a king,EA97,Greywacke,30th Dynasty,From Egypt,"Green siltstone head of a statue of a king: this royal head wears a 'nemes' with a uraeus, the hood of which was a separate piece, probably of gold or some other metal, which is now gone. Apart from the loss of its nose, which was further damaged by at least one attempt to repair it, the face is extremely well preserved. This face is mask-like. The king is possibly Ahmose II, now more probably Nectanebo I.","This fine green siltstone head exhibits the bland, serene features typical of Late Period (661-332 BC) and Ptolemaic sculpture. It has been suggested that it either represents Amasis (570-526 BC) of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty or Nectanebo I (380-362 BC) of the Thirtieth Dynasty. The highly polished stone is also typical of later sculptures.Repairs have been made to the statue at some date, perhaps in the Roman period (after 30 BC). The nose and uraeus on the king's brow appear to have been damaged at some point, and the surfaces were then shaped to take separate replacement pieces. An extra slot for a peg to hold the nose in place can be seen. Repairs like this are common in Egyptian sculpture.",
"Statue of Ramesses II, the 'Younger Memnon'","Statue of Ramesses II, the 'Younger Memnon'",EA19,"Granodiorite,red granite",19th Dynasty,"From the Ramesseum, Karnak","Head and upper body of pink/grey granite monumental statue of Ramses II (one of a pair placed before the door of the Ramesseum) wearing nemes head-cloth and circlet of uraei (about half now lost), the sculptor has exploited the bichrome nature of the stone to emphasise the division between body and face; the dorsal pillar is inscribed with vertical registers of hieroglyphs - giving the name and titles of the king and part of a dedication to Amun-Ra; in 1817 it was noted that there were traces of colour upon the statue and it may have, therefore, been painted red in antiquity.","One of the largest pieces of Egyptian sculpture in the British Museum, this statue shows Ramesses II, who succeeded his father Sethos I in around 1279 BC and ruled Egypt for 67 years. Weighing 7.25 tons, this fragment of his statue was cut from a single block of two-coloured granite. He is shown wearing the nemes headdress surmounted by a cobra diadem. The sculptor has used a slight variation of normal conventions to relate his work to the viewer, angling the eyes down slightly, so that the statue relates more to those looking at it. It was retrieved from the mortuary temple of Ramesses at Thebes (the 'Ramesseum') by the explorer and archaeologist Giovanni Belzoni in 1816. Belzoni wrote a fascinating account of his struggle to remove it, both literally, given its colossal size, and politically. The hole on the right of the torso is said to have been made by members of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt at the end of the eighteenth century, in an unsuccessful attempt to remove the statue. The imminent arrival of the head in England in 1818 inspired the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley to write 'Ozymandias': '... My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair! Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away.' After its arrival in the British Museum, the 'Younger Memnon' was perhaps the first piece of Egyptian sculpture to be recognized as a work",

It was being used for ritual washing - hence the plug-holes cut in the base - in the mosque of Ibn Tulun, one of the oldest in Cairo.The exterior is decorated with texts and figures of various funerary deities. The design, and the texts that do not refer to Hapmen (the owner of the tomb) are almost exact copies of those on the sarcophagus found in the tomb of King Thutmose III (1479-1425 BC) in the Valley of the Kings. Since no other copy of this sarcophagus type is known in the intervening period (over 800 years), it seems that either someone visited the royal tomb and took the design back, or an original design for the sarcophagus was uncovered. Either way, it was used in a monument consciously intended to recall the style of an earlier period.It is a fascinating example of the continuity of Egyptian practice, spread over both time and place, since it is most probable that Hapmen was buried somewhere in the Saqqara/Giza or Lower Egypt area. However, his tomb has never been found, and it is not known how the sarcophagus reached Cairo.The sarcophagus came to the British Museum from the French after the Treaty of Alexandria.",
Statue,Statue,EA43,Granodiorite,"18th Dynasty, circa 1400 BC","From Karnak, Egypt","Granodiorite statue in the form of Mutemwia, wife of Thutmose IV and mother of Amenhotep III, in the guise of the goddess Mut, protected by the wings of a vulture and enthroned upon a sacred boat, the upper-body is broken away, the hands were placed on the thighs and the right holds an ankh, part of the head of the figure is also preserved (see EA 43A), the prow is elaborated with Hathor-heads and the base of a sistrum, the stern is wanting; hieroglyphs, at the feet of the figure, give the name and titles of the queen and each side of the boat is incised with a wedjat-eye and an elongated-cartouche also giving the name and titles of the queen, the prow is inscribed with cartouches containing the prenomen and nomen of Amenhotep III.","Mutemwia was the principal wife of Thutmose IV (1400-1390 BC) and the mother of Amenhotep III (1390-1352 BC). She helped establish a temple to the goddess Mut, south-east of the Temple of Amun at Karnak. It is possible that this sculpture may have originated there. It was discovered in the floor of the main sanctuary at Karnak. The sculpture is almost certainly votive, an object offered to a deity in the hope of fulfilment of a particular wish. The piece makes great play on the association between the name of the goddess and that of the dedicator; the figure in the boat is probably meant to represent Mutemwia in the guise of Mut. There is also a clever play on the relationship between the two names and the design of the sculpture: Mutemwia means 'Mut is in the barque' which is exactly what the sculpture represents. At the prow of the barque is a sistrum (rattle) with a head of Hathor, a sacred symbol normally associated with women.",
